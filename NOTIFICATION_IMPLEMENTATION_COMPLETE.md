## 📦 Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "@microsoft/signalr": "^8.x.x",
  "date-fns": "^3.x.x"
}
```

## 🔐 Security Features

- JWT Bearer token authentication for all connections
- Course enrollment verification
- Instructor permission checks
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure SignalR connection setup

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Students:
1. **Enable Notifications**: Go to any enrolled course detail page and toggle notifications ON
2. **Real-time Updates**: See the notification bell in navbar light up with new notifications
3. **View Notifications**: Click the bell to see notification history and mark as read
4. **Auto-subscribe**: When viewing course content, automatically join the notification group

### For Instructors:
1. **Create Notifications**: Go to course content management → Notifications tab
2. **Choose Type**: Select from announcement, assignment, reminder, etc.
3. **Send Instantly**: Notifications are delivered in real-time to all subscribed students
4. **Target Audience**: Only enrolled students who have notifications enabled receive them

### For Testing:
1. Visit `/demo/notifications` (requires login)
2. Test SignalR connection status
3. Join/leave course groups
4. Send test notifications (instructors only)
5. Monitor real-time delivery

## 🔧 Backend Requirements

Your SignalR hub should implement these methods:

```csharp
// Hub Methods to Implement
public async Task JoinCourseGroup(int courseId)
public async Task LeaveCourseGroup(int courseId)
public async Task<List<CourseNotification>> GetCourseNotifications(int userId, int courseId, bool unreadOnly)
public async Task MarkCourseNotificationAsRead(int notificationId, int userId)
public async Task MarkAllCourseNotificationsAsRead(int userId, int courseId)

// Hub Events to Trigger
await Clients.Group($"course_{courseId}").SendAsync("ReceiveCourseNotification", notification);
```

## 📝 API Endpoints Required

```http
POST /Notifications/create-course-notification
GET /Notifications/get-course-notifications/{courseId}?unreadOnly={bool}
POST /Notifications/mark-notification-asread/{notificationId}
POST /Notifications/mark-all-notifications-asread/{courseId}
```

## 🎯 Key Features

✅ **Real-time delivery** via SignalR WebSockets  
✅ **Fallback support** via HTTP API for offline users  
✅ **Subscription management** per course  
✅ **Multiple notification types** (announcement, assignment, etc.)  
✅ **Read/unread status** tracking  
✅ **Mobile responsive** design  
✅ **Connection monitoring** and auto-reconnection  
✅ **Authentication integration** with JWT tokens  
✅ **Role-based permissions** (students subscribe, instructors create)  
✅ **Course enrollment verification**  
✅ **Toast notifications** for immediate feedback
