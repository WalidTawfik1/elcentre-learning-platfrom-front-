# Notification System Fix Summary

## Problem
The notification system was encountering 404 errors when trying to call non-existent backend endpoints for subscription management:
- `GET /Notifications/subscription-status/{courseId}` - 404 Not Found
- `POST /Notifications/subscribe/{courseId}` - 404 Not Found

These errors were breaking the notification subscription toggle functionality across the platform.

## Solution
Refactored the notification system to work entirely with frontend state management and SignalR groups, eliminating the dependency on backend subscription endpoints.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Notification Service (`src/services/notification-service.ts`)
- **Removed**: `toggleNotificationSubscription()`, `getNotificationSubscription()`, and `getAllSubscriptions()` methods that were calling non-existent endpoints
- **Added**: Comment explaining that subscription management is handled entirely through SignalR groups

### 2. Enhanced Notification Hook (`src/hooks/use-notifications.tsx`)
- **Added**: Local subscription management using localStorage
- **Added**: `LocalNotificationSubscription` interface for frontend subscription state
- **Added**: `isSubscribedToCourse()`, `toggleCourseSubscription()`, and `getAllSubscriptions()` methods
- **Added**: Auto-subscription functionality for enrolled courses
- **Enhanced**: SignalR initialization to auto-join subscribed course groups
- **Enhanced**: Auto-subscribe students to their enrolled courses on first connection

### 3. Updated Notification Subscription Toggle (`src/components/notifications/notification-subscription-toggle.tsx`)
- **Removed**: Backend API calls for subscription management
- **Removed**: Loading states that depended on backend API calls
- **Updated**: Uses new local subscription management from the notification hook
- **Enhanced**: Checks for SignalR connection status before allowing toggles

### 4. Updated Course Learn Page (`src/pages/my-courses/[id]/learn.tsx`)
- **Enhanced**: Only auto-joins course groups if user is subscribed to notifications for that course
- **Added**: Dependency on `isSubscribedToCourse` to the useEffect

## Key Features

### Local Subscription Management
- Subscriptions are stored in localStorage per user: `notifications_subscriptions_{userId}`
- Each subscription contains: `courseId`, `isSubscribed`, and optional `courseName`
- Subscriptions persist across browser sessions

### Auto-Subscription for Enrolled Courses
- When a student first connects to SignalR, the system automatically checks their enrolled courses
- If no subscription preference exists for an enrolled course, it creates one with `isSubscribed: true`
- This ensures students receive notifications for their courses by default

### Real-time Group Management
- When users toggle subscriptions, they immediately join/leave the corresponding SignalR groups
- On SignalR connection, users auto-join all groups for courses they're subscribed to
- Group membership is managed entirely on the frontend without backend persistence

### Global Notification Coverage
- Notifications work across the entire platform, not just on the learn page
- The notification bell in the navbar shows real-time notifications from all subscribed courses
- Course detail pages show subscription toggles for enrolled students
- Learn pages auto-join groups based on subscription status

## Benefits
1. **No Backend Dependencies**: Eliminates errors from non-existent endpoints
2. **Better Performance**: No API calls needed for subscription status checks
3. **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time subscription toggles without waiting for API responses
4. **Auto-Enrollment**: Students automatically receive notifications for their courses
5. **Persistent Preferences**: User preferences saved locally and restored on reconnection
6. **Global Coverage**: Notifications work everywhere on the site, not just specific pages

## Testing
- Project builds successfully without errors
- No more 404 errors for notification subscription endpoints
- Subscription toggles work immediately without API dependencies
- SignalR groups are properly managed based on local subscription state
