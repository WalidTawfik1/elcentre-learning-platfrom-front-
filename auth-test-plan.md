# Authentication Persistence Test Plan

## Issue Description
Users were being redirected to login page after refreshing the page, particularly on "My Courses" and "Learn" pages, even when they should remain authenticated.

## Root Cause
Authentication system was checking `isAuthenticated` immediately without waiting for the authentication loading state to complete during the localStorage restoration process.

## Fixed Components

### 1. Core Authentication Hook (`src/hooks/use-auth.tsx`)
- ✅ Added localStorage-based user persistence
- ✅ Enhanced fetchUser function with localStorage fallback
- ✅ Improved initialization with immediate user restoration
- ✅ Better error handling for API failures
- ✅ Enhanced logout to clear all cookie variants

### 2. Authentication Service (`src/services/auth-service.ts`)
- ✅ Added debug utilities (`checkAuthState()`)
- ✅ Enhanced cookie handling functions

### 3. Fixed Pages
- ✅ `src/pages/my-courses/index.tsx` - Added authLoading check
- ✅ `src/pages/my-courses/[id]/learn.tsx` - Added authLoading check
- ✅ `src/pages/dashboard/instructor/courses.tsx` - Added authLoading check
- ✅ `src/pages/dashboard/instructor/edit-course.tsx` - Added authLoading check

### 4. Already Properly Protected
- ✅ `src/components/auth/require-auth.tsx` - Already handles isLoading correctly
- ✅ `src/components/auth/require-admin-auth.tsx` - Already handles isLoading correctly

## Test Scenarios

### Primary Test Case
1. **Login Test**
   - Navigate to `/login`
   - Login with valid credentials
   - Verify user is redirected appropriately

2. **My Courses Page Refresh**
   - Navigate to `/my-courses`
   - Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
   - ✅ **Expected**: User remains on the page, no redirect to login
   - ❌ **Previous**: User was redirected to login page

3. **Learn Page Refresh**
   - Navigate to `/my-courses/{courseId}/learn`
   - Refresh the page
   - ✅ **Expected**: User remains on the page, no redirect to login
   - ❌ **Previous**: User was redirected to login page

### Secondary Test Cases
4. **Instructor Dashboard Refresh**
   - Login as instructor
   - Navigate to instructor pages
   - Refresh the page
   - ✅ **Expected**: User remains authenticated

5. **Network Failure Resilience**
   - Login successfully
   - Simulate network failure (disconnect internet)
   - Refresh the page
   - ✅ **Expected**: User stays authenticated using localStorage data

6. **Token Expiry Handling**
   - Login successfully
   - Wait for token to expire (or manually clear JWT cookie)
   - Refresh the page
   - ✅ **Expected**: User is logged out and redirected to login

### Edge Cases
7. **Corrupted localStorage**
   - Login successfully
   - Manually corrupt localStorage data
   - Refresh the page
   - ✅ **Expected**: System gracefully handles corruption

8. **Partial Cookie Clearing**
   - Login successfully
   - Clear only some auth cookies
   - Refresh the page
   - ✅ **Expected**: System handles partial state correctly

## How to Test

### Manual Testing
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser to `http://localhost:5173`
3. Login with test credentials
4. Navigate to `/my-courses`
5. Press F5 to refresh
6. Verify you stay on the page

### Browser Developer Tools Testing
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Check Application > Local Storage for `elcentre_user` data
3. Check Application > Cookies for JWT token
4. Monitor Console for auth-related logs
5. Monitor Network tab for API calls during refresh

### Debug Commands
Use these in browser console to debug auth state:
```javascript
// Check current auth state
('Auth State:', {
  isAuthenticated: !!localStorage.getItem('elcentre_user'),
  hasJwtCookie: document.cookie.includes('jwt='),
  userData: JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('elcentre_user') || 'null')
});

// Check JWT cookie
('JWT Cookie:', document.cookie.split(';').find(c => c.trim().startsWith('jwt=')));
```

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Users remain authenticated after page refresh on all protected pages
- ✅ Authentication state persists across browser sessions
- ✅ Graceful handling of network failures during auth restoration
- ✅ Proper logout clears all authentication data
- ✅ No TypeScript errors in modified files

## Implementation Summary

The fix involved adding proper loading state checks to prevent premature redirects during the authentication restoration process. The key changes were:

1. **Wait for auth loading**: Pages now check `authLoading` before making authentication decisions
2. **localStorage persistence**: User data is stored in localStorage and restored on app initialization
3. **Fallback mechanisms**: When API calls fail but JWT exists, restore from localStorage
4. **Enhanced error handling**: Better handling of network issues and corrupted data

This ensures a smooth user experience where authenticated users stay logged in across page refreshes and browser sessions.
